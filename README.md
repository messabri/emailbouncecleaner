# Email Bounce Cleaner

## Installation and Usage
Verify Port 25:
Ensure that port 25 is open on your system to enable email communication. You can check this using a tool like telnet or nmap.
Check PHP Installation:
Verify that PHP is installed on your system. You can check this by running php -v in your terminal. If it's not installed, download and install it from the official PHP website (https://www.php.net/).
Run the Script:
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you've placed the bnc.php script.
Execute the script using the following command:
Bash
php bnc.php


## Input and Output

Input: The script requires a file with email addresses to verify, one per line (checkme.txt).
Output: Bounce check results will be displayed in the terminal and saved to a file.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors, carefully review the error messages and consult the script's documentation or support resources for assistance.
Check for common issues like incorrect file paths, missing dependencies, or configuration errors.
